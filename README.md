# Virtual Swear Jar

### Summary
A silly little program that uses browser-based speechRecognition to continually monitor the microphone for a list of censored words, emitting a beep sound any time one is detected.

*Note that unfortunately this program does not work on mobile devices of any kind due to recording limitations and security restrictions.*
