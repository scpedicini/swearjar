# Virtual Swear Jar

![Swear Jar](./assets/swearjar.jpg)

### Summary
A silly little program that uses browser-based speechRecognition to continually monitor the microphone for a list of censored words, emitting a beep sound any time one is detected.

*Note that unfortunately this program does not work on mobile devices of any kind due to recording limitations and security restrictions.*




> ⚠️ This app doesn't work outside of strict Chrome due to the SpeechRecognition API being limited on most browsers - even Chromium forks such as Brave. It may be worth migrating to a clientside whisper fork.
